# CFS-Website
The start to a website I have been making for a company called Curtain Fitting Services. This is a soft furnishings company that can fit curtains, blinds and shutters.
This company does not have a website at the moment so I thought as a project I would try to make one even if it does not become their official website. 

## Description
This is the start to a new project I am creating. Right now the website is not responsive and I have not added any code to the shutters.html, blinds.html and the curtains.html.
However I will be adding code to that soon. Currently I have finished the home page, contact page and the about us page. 
The website is also not currently responsive but that too will also be added soon.
